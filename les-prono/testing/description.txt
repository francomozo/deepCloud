Hey! This is the testing folder.

Here we will simulate and check the correct behavior of the
system.

The system relies on the sat_data folder, that gets images
and masks as time passes. There are many cases to be considered.

1 - regular sequence of day images
  base case. all are useful images and arrive regularly.
  this means that the period is perfect.

2 - irregular sequence of day images
  2.1 - the period has some added noise, so it is not exactly
  what it is supposed to be
  2.2 - the period is perfect but there are holes
    2.2.1 - only one absent image (day 106)
    2.2.2 - more than one absent image in a row
  2.3 - all of the above 2.1 + 2.2.1 + 2.2.2

3 - sequence of night images
  (the output should be zero)

4 - transitions
  4.1 - start of the day, from night images to day images
  4.2 - end of the day, from day images to night images
  4.3 - consecutive days (check all predictions are there)

we will select period / doy in [113, 115]
113 is regular, 115 has holes
